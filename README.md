## Description
Simulating Quantum Algorithms including Shor's Algorithm and Deutsch-Jozsa's Algorithms.

## Dependency
Use C++ [Eigen Library](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)

## Guide
- First, set up the dependency (C++ Eigen).
- Put all files in the same directory, then include `Quantum.hpp`.
